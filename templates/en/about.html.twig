                            Allow me to introduce myself.
                            I'm a skilled web developer based in Belarus with expertise in PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CS and
                            various frameworks such as Symfony and Laravel. I have been working in the field since 2012,
                            gaining valuable experience with enterprise projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the moment I am working as web-developer in the hosting company: hoster.by.
                            I do love what i do in the intersection of hardware and software.
                            In addition to my main job, I also work as a self-employed developer. I have a passion for
                            creating custom themes without relying on plugins, utilizing tools like Gulp, Webpack, and
                            SVG animation to enhance the user experience. My proficiency extends to content management
                            systems like WordPress, although I prefer the flexibility of building tailored solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By university education I am a research physicist.
                            Being fluent in English, Belarusian, and having some knowledge of German, I am able to
                            effectively communicate with clients from various backgrounds.
                            I can understand Polish and Ukrainian well, often i'm reading their news in original without translator.
                            I am open to freelance
                            opportunities and would love to work on small projects for customers across the European
                            Union.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I am committed to staying in Belarus and not considering relocation, I am enthusiastic
                            about traveling. Exploring new places and cultures broadens my perspective and inspires
                            creativity in my work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
